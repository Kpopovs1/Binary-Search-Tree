# Binary-Search-Tree
Using C++:
implement a templated Binary Search Tree and to measure the runtime of the 
implementation. BST class should support the following public member functions, with 
the usual definitions:
•	bool insert(const T &);
•	bool remove(const T &);
•	bool find(const T &) const;
•	void display() const; // inorder display
code should reject duplicate insertions. Design a set of tests to see whether 
implementation can show the difference between runtime complexity of balanced trees vs. 
unbalanced trees, for different problem sizes. To be very clear, do not implement a 
balanced binary tree! Recall and exploit the fact that insertion order influences the 
shape and characteristics of the tree.
